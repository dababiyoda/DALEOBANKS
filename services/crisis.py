crisis.py
------------

This module defines a lightweight crisis detection service for the
DaLeoBanks agent. The purpose of this service is to monitor
incoming content for signs of emerging crises, such as scandals,
emergencies, or highly negative sentiment. When a potential crisis is
detected, downstream systems can adjust behaviourâ€”slowing posting
cadence, switching into monitoring mode, or escalating to human
operators.

The implementation intentionally avoids heavy dependencies and does not
perform any network requests. Instead, it relies on a simple keyword
watch list and a basic sentiment score supplied by the
``SentimentService``. This makes it suitable for environments where
external API access is restricted or costly.
