------------

The websearch module implements a minimal evidence gate for the
DaLeoBanks agent. Its primary purpose is to validate that generated
content includes at least one citation to a credible external source.
Because network requests may not be possible in the deployment
environment, the implementation uses simple heuristics rather than
actual web search APIs.

Credible citations are recognized via URL patterns. Domains ending in
``.gov``, ``.edu`` or wellâ€‘known international news sources are
considered trustworthy. This list can be extended over time. The
``WebSearchService`` exposes helper methods to extract URLs from
content and to verify their credibility.
