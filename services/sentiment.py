-------------

This module exposes a very lightweight sentiment analysis service. It
uses simple word lists to score text on a scale from -1 (very
negative) to +1 (very positive). The service is intended as a safe
fallback when external API calls (such as to OpenAI or other NLP
providers) are unavailable. It deliberately avoids network requests
and heavyweight ML libraries.

The scoring algorithm counts occurrences of predefined positive and
negative words. The final sentiment score is the normalized difference
between positive and negative counts. Unknown words have no effect.
